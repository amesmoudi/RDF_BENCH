# PQDAG Installation Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing and setting up PQDAG, a distributed query processing system for RDF data. The setup process is divided into three main stages: **Fragmentation**, **Allocation**, and **Core System Installation**. Links to detailed READMEs for each stage are provided.

### 1. Fragmentation

The first step in setting up PQDAG is **fragmentation**, where RDF data is divided into smaller, manageable fragments. 

For detailed instructions on performing fragmentation, please refer to the [Fragmentation README](./Fragmentation/README.md).

---

### 2. Allocation

After fragmentation, the next step is **allocation**, where each fragment is assigned to a specific machine or node. 

Instructions for the allocation process are available in the [Allocation README](./Allocation/README.md).

---

### 3. Core System Installation

Once fragmentation and allocation are complete, proceed with the **installation of the PQDAG core system**. The core system includes the components required to process queries over the fragmented and allocated RDF data.

To install and configure the PQDAG core system, follow the steps in the [Core System Installation README](./CORE/README.md).

Each stage in this guide is crucial for setting up PQDAG correctly. Please refer to each linked README for specific commands, dependencies, and configurations.
